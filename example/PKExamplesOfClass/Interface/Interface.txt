        Why use Java interface?

            There are mainly three reasons to use interface. They are given below.

            - It is used to achieve abstraction.
            - By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
            - It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

        Compiler:

            .Java                       .Class
            Interfce NameOfInterfce{	Interfce NameOfInterfce{
            int aInt = 1;			    public static final int aInt = 1;
            void print();			    public abstract void print();
            }				            }

        Interface in Java:

            - Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
            - It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class.
            - Since Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface.
            - Since Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.

        The relationship between classes and interfaces & Multiple inheritance in Java by interface:

            class 		> extends > 	class // only one
            class 		> implements > 	interface, interface, ... // unlimitedly
            interface 	> extends > 	interface, interface, ... // unlimitedly

        NOTE:
            Question    :   Multiple inheritance is not supported through class in java,
                            but it is possible by an interface, why?
            Answer      :   It is because its implementation is provided by the implementation class.

            Question    :   What is marker or tagged interface?
            Answer      :   An interface which has no member is known as a marker or tagged interface,
                            for example, Serializable, Cloneable, Remote, etc.
                            They are used to provide some essential information to the JVM
                            so that JVM may perform some useful operation.

        Interface inheritance:

            A class implements an interface, but one interface extends another interface.

        It can have a method body:

            Only default method and static function can have. ( Java 8 )

        Nested Interface in Java:

            An interface can have another interface which is known as a nested interface.
